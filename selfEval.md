# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
** It was a frustrating experience at times, although the objects clicked for me maybe the fastest of all the lessons so far. I also had some practice by this point with searching up new information correctly and finding reputable sources. **
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.? 
** I am good at taking breaks when I need to and chunking my assignments, although my Adderall prescription has been out of stock due to the shortage for a while so I have had trouble staying focused when I hit a bump or while trabnsitioning between chunks. **
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
** I want to remember to revisit prior lessons as needed, and to seek help from teammates sometimes to avoid the quick spiral of floundering and frustration. **
